# Requirements: Home Add Pet Button Fix

*Generated from conversation on 2025-01-07*

## Objective
Fix the "page not found" error when users tap the "+" buttons on the home screen by redirecting them to the functional pet tab where they can add pets successfully.

## Core Requirements

### Must Have (High Priority)
- [HIGH] Fix Floating Action Button (FAB) on home screen to navigate to `/(tabs)/pets` instead of `/pet/add`
- [HIGH] Fix "Add Pet" button in pet list section to navigate to `/(tabs)/pets` instead of `/pet/add`
- [HIGH] Fix empty state "Add your first pet" button to navigate to `/(tabs)/pets` instead of `/pet/add`
- [HIGH] Ensure all button navigation works consistently and doesn't show "page not found"

### Should Have (Medium Priority)
- [MEDIUM] Maintain existing UI/UX - don't change button appearance or placement
- [MEDIUM] Use same navigation method (`router.push`) as existing code
- [MEDIUM] Ensure navigation works from all three button locations consistently

## Technical Constraints
- **Framework/Stack:** React Native with Expo Router, TypeScript
- **File Locations:** Home screen at `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, Pet tab at `app/(tabs)/pets.tsx`
- **Navigation Method:** Uses `useRouter` from `expo-router` with `router.push()`
- **Performance:** No performance impact - simple route change
- **Scale:** Local fix affecting 3 button handlers only

## User Context
**Target Users:** Pawpa app users trying to add pets from the home screen
**Primary Use Case:** User wants to add their first pet or additional pets from the main app screen
**User Flow:** Home screen → tap "+" button → currently shows "page not found" → should navigate to Pet tab

## Edge Cases & Considerations
- The route `/pet/add` doesn't exist in the app structure, only `/pet/[id]` for existing pets
- Pet tab already has a working FAB that opens `PetModal` for adding pets
- Need to maintain consistency with existing navigation patterns
- Should check if navigation method needs different route format for tab navigation

## Implicit Requirements
*Inferred from conversation context - please verify:*
- [Navigation] Target route should be `/(tabs)/pets` for tab navigation
- [Consistency] Should not change button styling or behavior other than navigation
- [Reliability] All three buttons must use the same fixed navigation
- [User Experience] Navigation should be smooth without loading delays
> **Note:** These requirements were surfaced by analyzing conversation patterns.

## Success Criteria
How we know this is complete and working:
- ✓ All three "+" buttons on home screen navigate to Pet tab without errors
- ✓ Users see "page not found" eliminated from this user flow
- ✓ Navigation works consistently (same route and method for all buttons)
- ✓ Existing functionality in Pet tab (working FAB) remains unaffected

## Next Steps
1. Review this PRD for accuracy and completeness
2. If anything is missing or unclear, continue the conversation
3. When ready, use the optimized prompt for implementation
