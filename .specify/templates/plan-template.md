# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Type Safety & Code Quality**:
- [ ] All code will use TypeScript strict mode with zero `any` types
- [ ] Zod schemas defined for all external data (API, user input)
- [ ] ESLint configuration aligned with project standards

**Testing Discipline**:
- [ ] Test strategy defined (unit/integration/component/contract)
- [ ] Test coverage target established (minimum 70% for services)
- [ ] TDD approach confirmed if specified in requirements

**User Experience Consistency**:
- [ ] UI components use React Native Paper theme tokens
- [ ] Dark mode support confirmed for all new components
- [ ] Accessibility requirements identified (labels, touch targets, screen readers)
- [ ] Loading and error states designed for all async operations

**Performance & Mobile Optimization**:
- [ ] TanStack Query cache strategy selected (IMMUTABLE/LONG/MEDIUM/SHORT/VERY_SHORT)
- [ ] Network-aware behavior planned (offline mode, error handling)
- [ ] Performance targets defined (API response time, memory usage, frame rate)
- [ ] Memory management strategy confirmed (request cancellation, cleanup)

**Architecture & Code Organization**:
- [ ] Feature fits within layered architecture (Screen → Component → State → Service → API)
- [ ] No business logic in screens, no API calls bypassing service layer
- [ ] File organization follows project conventions
- [ ] Component reuse verified (check existing components before creating new)

**Simplicity & Complexity Justification**:
- [ ] Feature scope limited to requirements (no gold-plating)
- [ ] No premature abstractions or over-engineering
- [ ] Any complexity violations documented with justification

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
